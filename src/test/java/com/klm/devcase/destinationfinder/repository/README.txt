Repository test is basically covered for this devcase purposes. On a real scenario, I should cover any combination of
input values

Service layer tests are not implemented since there is no real business logic there.

Controller tests use MockMvc but are poorly generic. I should test queries and run some negative tests. Easy, just need time.
